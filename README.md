**Bonus Task !** 

This is a cool one. You won't believe but this is a job Interview/excersie, you can be asked to draw your face in CSS in a limited time.

Feel free to check out this [Blog!](https://blog.prototypr.io/how-to-draw-your-face-in-css-89676e71236a). You may animate the drawing if you like.
